# 🧮 Employee Insights SQL Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project aimed to dives into employee data to uncover actionable insights using SQL. It mimics real-world HR and business analysis tasks—from salary comparisons to workforce demographics and potential cost-cutting strategies.

This project includes aggregations, joins, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.


## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset consists of three tables:

- **employee_demographics** – Employee ID, name, age, gender, birth date  
- **employee_salary** – Salary, occupation, department assignment  
- **parks_departments** – Department ID and names  


## 🛠️ SQL Skills Demonstrated

- Joins
- Aggregations (`AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`)
- Window Functions (`RANK() OVER`)
- Subqueries 
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- `CASE` Statements
- Grouping, Filtering, Sorting
- Scenario-based business questions


## 📈 Key Takeaways

- Ability to analyze structured data from multiple dimensions (salary, department, age, etc.)
- Translate business questions into precise SQL queries
- Identify inconsistencies and prepare the data for decision support
- Showcase real-world analytical thinking using SQL

## 📊 Analysis Sections & Business Questions

### 🔹 Department & Salary Analysis

- What is the average salary per department, and how does it compare to the overall average?
```sql
SELECT sal.dept_id, dept.department_name, 
	AVG(sal.salary) AS dept_avg_salary,
	(SELECT AVG(salary) 
    FROM employee_salary) AS overall_average
FROM employee_salary sal
JOIN parks_departments dept ON sal.dept_id = dept.department_id	
GROUP BY sal.dept_id
ORDER BY AVG(sal.salary) DESC;
```
| dept_id | department_name       | dept_avg_salary | overall_average |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 6       | Finance                | 71000.00         | 58350.00         |
| 3       | Public Works           | 66800.00         | 58350.00         |
| 1       | Parks and Recreation   | 56428.57         | 58350.00         |
| 4       | Healthcare             | 52500.00         | 58350.00         |
| 5       | Library                | 45000.00         | 58350.00         |
- Which departments have the largest salary range?
```sql
SELECT sal.dept_id, 
	dept.department_name, 
	MAX(sal.salary) AS highest_salary, 
    MIN(sal.salary) AS lowest_salary, 
    (MAX(sal.salary) - MIN(sal.salary)) AS salary_range
FROM employee_salary sal
JOIN parks_departments dept ON sal.dept_id = dept.department_id		
GROUP BY sal.dept_id
ORDER BY salary_range DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```
| dept_id | department_name | highest_salary | lowest_salary | salary_range |
|---------|------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 3       | Public Works     | 95000          | 30000          | 65000          |
- Rank all employees by salary within their department.
```sql
SELECT dept.department_name, 
	sal.first_name, 
    sal.last_name, 
    sal.salary,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY sal.dept_id ORDER BY sal.salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employee_salary sal
JOIN parks_departments dept ON sal.dept_id = dept.department_id
ORDER BY dept.department_name;
```
Sample output:

| Parks and Recreation   | Ron         | Swanson        | 70000  | 2            |
| ...                   | ...         | ...            | ...    | ...          |
- Find occupations shared by multiple employees and compute average salary.
```sql
SELECT dept.department_name, 
	sal.occupation, 
    COUNT(sal.employee_id) AS employee_count, 
    ROUND(AVG(sal.salary), 2) AS occupation_salary_avg
FROM employee_salary sal
JOIN parks_departments dept ON sal.dept_id = dept.department_id
GROUP BY dept.department_name, sal.occupation
HAVING COUNT(sal.employee_id) > 1;
```
| department_name       | occupation          | employee_count | occupation_salary_avg |
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Parks and Recreation   | Office Manager      | 2                | 55000.00               |

    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY sal.dept_id ORDER BY sal.salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employee_salary sal

- Salary band breakdown (Low / Medium / High) per department.
```sql
SELECT dept.department_name,
	CASE 
		WHEN sal.salary < 50000 THEN "Low"
		WHEN sal.salary > 70000 THEN "High"
		ELSE "Medium" 
	END AS "salary_band",
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count

JOIN employee_salary sal ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
JOIN parks_departments dept ON sal.dept_id = dept.department_id
GROUP BY dept.department_name, salary_band

Sample output: 
| department_name       | salary_band | employee_count |
|------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Public Works           | High         | 2               |
| Public Works           | Medium       | 2               |
| Public Works           | Low          | 1               |

### 🔹 Data Quality & Inconsistencies

- Employees with missing department info.
```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, occupation, dept_id
FROM employee_salary
WHERE dept_id IS NULL;
```
*Data not shown (placeholder for logic result)*

- Duplicate employee names with different IDs.
```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employee_demographics
WHERE (first_name, last_name) IN (
	SELECT first_name, last_name 
    FROM employee_demographics
    GROUP BY first_name, last_name 
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) > 1
);
``` 
| employee_id | first_name | last_name    | occupation                  | dept_id |
